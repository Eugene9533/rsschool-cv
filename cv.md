### **Summary**
---
I noticed that I have always been able to understand the algorithms and logic of various processes quite easily. Using all the advantages of technology what can be done in our digital age? Of course, the choice fell on programming. The Java Script language was chosen because of the large amount of documentation in different languages, the great popularity, the lower threshold of entry, the need for specialists and the ability to visually see the results of the work. At the moment my main priority in the near future is to get as much experience in programming as possible by self-studying materials and taking various courses to start my career in the wonderful world of algorithms and different data structures. No experience in programming on real projects, but there is a great desire to learn, understand and, of course, make money with this knowledge. In the future, I would like to go deeper into these processes and try my hand at back-end development.
